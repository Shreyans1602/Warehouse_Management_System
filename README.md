# Warehouse_Management_System
Note: This is a project I made over-night to compete in a hackathon (This project did win that hackathon though :)) and for a mini project requirement for 3 credits. Do not expect it to be efficient. You can probably use it as a reference for some approaches useful if you are making a similar project.
